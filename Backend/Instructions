first add those front end files in vscode and install all dependencies simultaneously configure 
the google Auth Client and get the key variables like client id ,client secret,refresh token, access token. 
another important thing is to organize the google drive correctly create a Music Folder in that create seperate folder for each genre and note those folder Ids.
Next add the things that are required in the frontend code.
One thing will be missing then that is server url for that go to vercel and create a project folder in that open a subfolder named "api".
In that api folder add .env file,server.js, vercel.json as i created api folder in that backend folder refer it .
one more thing in the vercel project add the environment variables such as client id, client secret, refresh token, access token, frontendurl and all.
